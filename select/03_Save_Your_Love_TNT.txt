I don't have a lot of time for yesterday
No sentimental baggage getting in my way
The less I have to carry round
The better I can treat you baby

Cause all the possibilities are in your eyes
Like looking at forever in two emerald skies
And if I keep you close to me
I'd have a life now baby

'Cause I know - ooh
You'll never kick me when I'm down
And I know - ooh
You're the best thing that I ever found, so

I'm gonna save your love
I'm gonna save your love I said
I'm gonna save your love
I'm gonna save your love

Been a lot of money slippin' through my hands
Yeah, the better things in life well I don't need 'em man
People getting nowhere with their
Long term plans now baby

It's only you
That I want to hold on to
You're the one
And I'm never letting go of you, hey

I'm gonna save your love
I'm gonna save your love I said
I'm gonna save your love
I'm gonna save your love
