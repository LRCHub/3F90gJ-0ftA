(Save your body, save your mind.)

I get going and you say what'll I do,
If you mess with someone new then its shoo fly shoo,
But if your heart's still in it,
Save your love for me.

My head's a tambourine,
My kidney's filled with stones,
And if your voice begins to irritate I'll need to be alone,
But don't you take it the wrong way,
Save your love for me.

This world's a colonoscopy,
Save your love for me.

I don't want any heart attack,
I just want to relax,
And if you want my head up on a stake just unlock and detach,
But first there's something out in the distance and it is so amazing.

Yeah it's so amazing.

(Save your body, save your mind)

I hate pressure,
I hate responsibility,
I always show up late and it takes me so long to leave,
But if you're willing to accept my flaws,
Save your love for me.

Oh yeah, I forgot about the jealousy,
And how angry I get for reasons I only perceive,
There's so much trouble brewing meanwhile,
Save your love for me.

This world's a colonoscopy, save your love for me.

I will
Be your doctor
And treat you
Well.

Well, so well.
