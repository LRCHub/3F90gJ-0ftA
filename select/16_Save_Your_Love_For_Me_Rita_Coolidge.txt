Wish I knew
Why I'm so in love with you
No one else in this world will do
Darling, please save your love for me

Run away
If I were wise I'd run away
But like a fool in love I stay
And pray you'll save your love for me

I can feel it
Even when you're not here
Can't conceal it
I really love you, my dear
And though I know no good
Can come from loving you
I can't do a thing, I'm so in love with you

So darling help me please
Have mercy on a fool like me
I know I'm lost but still I plead
Darling please save your love for me

I can feel it
Even when you're not here
Can't conceal it
I really love you, my dear
And though I know no good
Can come from loving you
I can't do a thing about it, I'm so in love with you

So darling, help me please
Have mercy on a fool like me
I know I'm lost but still I plead
Darling, please save your love for me

You may have fun with the crowd
But for crying out loud
Darling, please save your love for me
